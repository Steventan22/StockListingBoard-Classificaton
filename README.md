# StockListingBoard-Classificaton

## Overview
This research project, titled "IDX Share Classification to the Listing Board Based on 5 Main Factors," is a collaborative effort by four UMN students. In the rapidly evolving stock market, predicting market trends has become crucial. The significant growth in stock market developments makes stock prediction essential for making informed investment decisions. Machine learning algorithms play a pivotal role in predicting stock trends.

The primary focus of this research is to predict and classify IDX shares into listing boards based on five main factors. The machine learning algorithms utilized for this classification are Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The performance and outcomes of both algorithms will be evaluated to determine the most effective approach.

## Background
Predicting stock market trends is vital in making informed investment decisions, especially considering the significant and dynamic changes in the stock market. Machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree and KNN, can be powerful tools in predicting stock trends. This research aims to classify IDX shares into listing boards based on five main factors, enhancing the understanding of the key determinants of stock classification.

## Objectives
Utilize Machine Learning Algorithms: Implement Decision Tree and KNN algorithms for stock classification.
Evaluate Algorithm Performance: Assess the performance of Decision Tree and KNN to determine the most accurate and effective algorithm.
Enhance Stock Market Efficiency: Improve the efficiency of the stock market by providing accurate and timely stock classification.
Aid Investor Decision-Making: Assist investors in making well-informed decisions when investing in stocks.

## Methodology
- Data Collection: Data used is taken from the acquisition of wildangunawan in https://github.com/wildangunawan/Dataset-Saham-IDX.
- Data Processing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Modeling: Apply Decision Tree and KNN algorithms to classify IDX shares into listing boards based on the identified factors.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of both algorithms using accuracy metrics.
- Results and Conclusion: Present the results, highlighting the algorithm with the highest accuracy and its implications for stock market efficiency and investor decision-making.

## Research Findings
The research findings indicate that the Decision Tree algorithm achieved slightly higher accuracy (76%) compared to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with an accuracy of 73%. This implies that the Decision Tree algorithm is more effective in classifying IDX shares into listing boards based on the identified factors.

## Disclaimer: 
The research findings are based on the data available at the time of the study which is early 2023 and may be subject to market changes. Investors are advised to conduct further research and seek professional advice before making investment decisions.
